# Specification readings

How this repository reads QTI 3.0 and the languages it embeds where a specification is silent, ambiguous or split
between its schema and its prose. Every package follows these readings: the qti package when it accepts or refuses a
document, and the renderer when it renders one, so the two never disagree about the same file. Each reading is an
operator ruling. A new reading lands here by pull request, and a package that needs one asks the operator first.

## Validity

1. **Nothing valid is refused.** Content that is valid QTI 3.0, including every language QTI embeds, is accepted.
   There are no exceptions. Content that is not valid is refused. (2026-10-30, restated without exceptions 2026-11-03.)
2. **MathML validity is the MathML 3 Recommendation**: its RelaxNG schema and its prose rules, not only the MathML XSD
   that QTI's schema imports. MathML that breaks a rule of the Recommendation, such as an operator applied to the wrong
   number of arguments or a piecewise expression with two `otherwise` parts, is invalid even when the QTI XSD accepts it.

## Scope of names and references

3. **In SSML, "the document" is each `speak` fragment.** An item may hold several `speak` fragments. SSML's rules
   that speak of the document (a `mark` name defined once, `startmark` and `endmark` naming a defined mark, a `lookup`
   naming a `lexicon`) apply within one fragment. Two fragments may each define `mark name="a"`. A reference from one
   fragment to a mark or lexicon in another does not resolve. (2026-11-03.)
4. **Prefixed variable references** (`ITEMREF.N.VAR`) are valid in a test's pre-conditions and branch rules as well as
   in its outcome processing, as QTI's information model and 1EdTech's own examples use them. (2026-11-03.)
5. **A section document** may hold prefixed references and `section-identifier`. They resolve once for each test that
   includes the section, not once for the section on its own. (2026-11-03.)

## Foreign content

6. **A QTI root, processing root or manifest global nested inside wildcard content** (where QTI admits elements from
   any namespace under lax validation) is valid. It is kept as foreign content like any other element: it is not
   refused, and it is not read as QTI. (2026-11-03.)
