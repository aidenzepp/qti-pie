Store QTI 3.0 packages in a strict PostgreSQL model, and export them unchanged.

pantry imports a QTI 3.0 package, a directory or a `.zip` file, into a local PostgreSQL database, and exports it back
to files. It exists first to put [grizzle](../../vendor/README.md) through a large, real data model, so delivery is
out of scope. It is pre-release, it is not a library (its `package.json` exports nothing), and it reads XML through
[crust](../crust/README.md).

## Install

From the repository root, after the setup in [qti-pie's README](../../README.md#install):

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

The database is grizzle's patched PostgreSQL 19rc1 on `localhost:5433`, with verify-full TLS only. [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md#local-database) describes how to build it and how to choose a server.

## Start

```console
$ cd packages/pantry
$ scripts/db.sh create
$ scripts/db.sh migrate
$ node src/cli.ts import ./my-package
$ node src/cli.ts export ./out <package-id>
$ node src/cli.ts roundtrip ./my-package
```

`import` prints the package id that `export` takes.

## Commands

| Command       | Writes                | Does                                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `import`      | the database          | Imports a package and prints its id                     |
| `export`      | files                 | Writes an imported package back out                     |
| `roundtrip`   | the database, files   | Imports, exports and compares the two                   |
| `schema`      | no                    | Prints the JSON Schema of `--output json`               |
| `completions` | no                    | Prints a shell completion script                        |

Every input is a path. Nothing is read from standard input. `--dry-run` reads and checks without writing. `export`
needs `--yes` to replace a directory that already has content. `--output json` prints one JSON value. `--help` is the reference for the flags and the exit codes.

An item ref may name an LTI link instead of an item. pantry accepts it and does not check the variable mappings or the
item-prefixed names that pass through it, because the package declares nothing the tool reports (spec reading 110).

`scripts/db.sh reset` drops the database and this package's roles, then creates and migrates again.

## Optional settings

Each is the local cluster's when unset or empty. `scripts/db.sh` reads them as `src/db/connection.ts` does.

- `GR8DES_PG_CA` names the PEM file a connection verifies the server against, in place of `tls/ca.crt` in grizzle's
  state folder (`GRIZZLE_PG_STATE`).
- `GR8DES_PG_MIGRATION_ROLE` names the role `grizzle migrate` connects as, in place of `grizzle_dev`.

## Development

[`docs/qti-intent.md`](../../docs/qti-intent.md) records what was settled before the model was planned. Read it before
changing the model. From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm --filter @qti-pie/pantry test
```

Tests that need the database use the local cluster. Agents start at [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

The vocabulary's derivations and the XSD differentials read the 23 XSDs that
[`src/vocab/derive/sources.ts`](src/vocab/derive/sources.ts) pins by URL and SHA-256, all published by 1EdTech under
`https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/`. They are cached outside the repository, in `~/.cache/gr8des/qti3/xsd/`:
`pnpm --filter @qti-pie/pantry run fetch-xsds` downloads them there and checks each digest. Without them those tests
are skipped, or fail naming that command.
